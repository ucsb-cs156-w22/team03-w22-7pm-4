Implement List page for CollegiateSubreddits 

Implement the List page using the Table component made in a previous issue.  For now, no need for the Edit and Delete columns (those will come later). 

You may use the UCSBStudentsIndexPage as a model.

- [ ] When loading the page, it fetches data from the backend and populates the table
- [ ] test coverage is 100% for `npm run coverage`
- [ ] test coverage is 100% for `npx stryker run`
