Add UCSBSubjects menu and page placeholders

The menu shows up only when logged in.  It has only one item for regular users (List) and two items for Admin users (List and Create). These links go to placeholder pages UCSBSubjectIndexPage and UCSBSubjectsCreatePage.

You can use the menu for Todos and the placeholder pages for Todos (already in the repo) as models.
