Implement List page for Earthquakes 

Implement the List page using the Table component made in a previous issue.  

No need for the Edit and Delete columns. 

You may use the UCSBStudentsIndexPage as a model.


- [ ] When loading the page, it fetches data from the backend and populates the table
- [ ] test coverage is 100% for `npm run coverage`
- [ ] test coverage is 100% for `npx stryker run`
